<p><strong>TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT</strong></p>
<p>April 22, 2022</p>
<p><strong>Description of SportsBubble Services and Acceptance of Terms of Use Including Arbitration of Disputes</strong></p>
<p>
SportsBubble Inc. ("SportsBubble," "our," "we" or "us") has developed this Terms of Use Agreement to describe the terms that govern your use of the SportsBubble Services (defined below). This Terms of Use Agreement, including any future modifications, ("Agreement") governs your use of the sports-related SportsBubble websites ("SportsBubble Sites"), applications and video services, messaging services, mobile services, text messaging campaigns, promotions, and any other features, content, promotions or applications offered from time to time by SportsBubble that link or otherwise refer users to this Agreement (collectively, the "SportsBubble Services"). SportsBubble is based in the United States and the SportsBubble Services are hosted in the United States.</p>
<p>
SportsBubble furnishes the SportsBubble Sites and other SportsBubble Services for your personal enjoyment and entertainment. By visiting the SportsBubble Sites (whether or not you are a registered member) or using a SportsBubble Service, you accept and agree to be bound by this Agreement and to abide by all applicable Laws, rules and regulations (collectively, "Applicable Law"). Please read through this Agreement carefully. SportsBubble may modify this Agreement at any time, and each such modification will be effective upon posting on the SportsBubble Sites. All material modifications will apply prospectively only. Your continued use of the SportsBubble Sites or any other SportsBubble Services following any modification of this Agreement constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to be bound by the Agreement as modified. Your continued use of the Service will signify your acceptance of the changes. If you do not accept the changes, you agree that your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Site. You may not consummate any transaction that was initiated using our Service that, by paying to us a fee, could cause us to violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance or regulation. It is therefore important that you review this Agreement regularly. If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement and to abide by all Applicable Law, you must discontinue use of all SportsBubble Services immediately and your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Services. </p>
<p>
Your access to and use of certain SportsBubble Services may require you to accept additional terms and conditions applicable to such SportsBubble Services, in addition to this Agreement, and may require you to download software or Content (as defined below). In the event of a conflict between any such additional terms and this Agreement, such additional terms will prevail.</p>
<p>
PLEASE NOTE THAT THE "ARBITRATION AGREEMENT" SECTION BELOW CONTAINS PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE (i) WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, ALL DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BE RESOLVED IN BINDING ARBITRATION, AND NOT IN COURT AND (ii) YOU AND SPORTSBUBBLE WAIVE THE RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH DISPUTES. BY USING THIS SITE AND ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.</p>
<p>
<strong>Registration and Security</strong></p>
<p>
Use of the SportsBubble Services is limited to users 13 years of age and older. Some SportsBubble Services require you to create an account (including setting up a WatchSports credential and password) to participate in or to secure additional SportsBubble Services, such as viewing Content, purchasing SportsBubble Services Products, creating a WatchSports Site profile and signing up for specific WatchSports notifications. You take full responsibility for your participation on WatchSports. As a condition of using certain features of SportsBubble, you may be required to register on WatchSports and/or select a username and password. All registration information you submit directly to us or through a Third-Party Service (defined below) to create an account must be accurate and must be kept updated by you. Your failure to do so will constitute a breach of the Agreement, which may result in immediate termination of your account. You may not (i) select or use as a username a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; or (ii) use as a username a name subject to any rights of another person without appropriate authorization. SportsBubble reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel, a username, in its sole discretion. It is your responsibility to notify us of any changes in such information, including, but not limited to your contact information. </p>
<p>
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all your passwords and are responsible for all use of your account. It is therefore critical that you do not share your account information with anyone. You may be held liable for losses incurred by SportsBubble, SportsBubble Affiliates (defined below) or any other SportsBubble user or visitor in the event someone else uses your account as a result of your failure to keep your account information secure and confidential and you agree to indemnify SportsBubble and all SportsBubble Affiliates from any third-party claims arising from such actions. You agree not to use the account, username, email address or password of another member or subscriber at any time and not to allow any other person to use your account. You agree to notify SportsBubble immediately if you suspect any unauthorized use of, or access to, your account or password. SportsBubble shall retain the right to change your username, but no obligation, for any reason, including, without limitation, if the username you have selected violates this Agreement. SportsBubble shall also retain the right, but no obligation, to review any profile pictures provided by you. Finally, you agree to provide us with, and maintain in your account profile, your current and active email address and other contact information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Access</strong></p>
<p>
The SportsBubble Services are intended solely for your personal and non-commercial use. SportsBubble may change, suspend or discontinue the SportsBubble Services (or any feature thereof) at any time. SportsBubble may also impose limits on certain features and services offered within the SportsBubble Services or restrict your access to parts or all of the SportsBubble Services without notice or liability. You acknowledge that from time to time the SportsBubble Services may be inaccessible or inoperable for any reason, including, without limitation: (i) equipment malfunctions; (ii) periodic maintenance procedures or repairs which Sportsbubble may undertake from time to time; or (iii) causes beyond the control of SportsBubble or which are not reasonably foreseeable by SportsBubble.</p>
<p>
<strong>Termination</strong></p>
<p>
Unless terminated by SportsBubble in its sole discretion, this Agreement remains in full force and effect while you use the SportsBubble Services. You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason.  SportsBubble may terminate your account, any subscription (both free and paid) and/or access to all (or any portion of) the SportsBubble Services at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice or any explanation, and shall have no liability to you for such termination. Furthermore, even after your account subscription and/or access to the SportsBubble Services is terminated by you or SportsBubble, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect with respect to your past and future use of the SportsBubble Services. If we terminate your user account, subscription and/or access to the SportsBubble Services (or any portion of the SportsBubble Services) you may not create a new account, purchase a new subscription or try to access the SportsBubble Services without SportsBubble’s prior written approval. You agree that your account and/or subscription is non-transferable. Any rights to your account and/or the SportsBubble Services terminate upon your death.</p>
<p>
<strong>Fees</strong></p>
<p>
You acknowledge that SportsBubble reserves the right to charge a fee for any portion of the SportsBubble Services. SportsBubble will provide you with advance notice of any such fees, including any change in the amount of such fees, and a way to cancel your account and/or subscription in the event you do not wish to pay the modified fee. If you continue to use the SportsBubble Services after the applicable fee has been imposed or increased, you agree that you are expressly agreeing to the subscription fee or increase thereto and you will be responsible for paying such fee for the balance of your subscription service. You will not be entitled to a refund of any unused portion of such fees or other payments if SportsBubble suspends or terminates your account, and/or access to a SportsBubble Service (or any portion of the SportsBubble Services), due to your breach of this Agreement or violation of Applicable Law, as determined by SportsBubble, in its sole discretion. Your only remedy will be to not use the Services and petition to reinstate your account, which will be in our sole discretion to reinstate.</p>
<p>
<strong>Purchasing SportsBubble Services or Products</strong></p>
<p>
In connection with a purchase of any service, subscription (including any premium subscription) or product on or in connection with the SportsBubble Sites or other SportsBubble Services (collectively, "SportsBubble Site Products"), you may be required to provide personal information, including your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card and billing information (collectively, "Personal Financial Information"), to an independent third party selected by, but not affiliated with, SportsBubble (the "Processor"). Where the Processor is responsible for collecting, transmitting and/or processing your Personal Financial Information and, in some instances, for fulfilling your order, the collection, transmission and processing of your Personal Financial Information and any and all payment obligations for SportsBubble Site Products shall be governed by the terms of use/service and privacy policy(ies) of the Processor. If you make a purchase of a SportsBubble Site Product, you are warranting that you are authorized to make the purchase using the form of payment that you provide to the Processor. You must be 18 years of age or older to purchase a SportsBubble Site Product. If you purchase certain subscription based SportsBubble Site Products, your subscription will be automatically renewed and the credit card you provided to the Processor for such SportsBubble Site Product will be charged per the billing cycle of your subscription (e.g., monthly, 3-month, 6-month, annual), unless you cancel the subscription thirty (30) days prior to the automatic renewal date of the subscription. The renewal charge for your subscription shall be the same as the original purchase price, unless you are otherwise notified in advance. You acknowledge and agree that the authorization to charge your credit card for the subscription shall automatically transfer to any successors or assigns of SportsBubble or the Processor, for a substantially similar subscription. Some subscription options include a free trial period. You are allowed only one free trial period. Subsequent subscriptions or upgrades do not qualify for additional free trials.</p>
<p>
SportsBubble makes no warranty, and to the fullest extent provided by law, accepts no liability for any loss or damages whatsoever, relating to or in connection with your placement of an order for a SportsBubble Site Product with the Processor.  SportsBubble provides no refunds for, makes no warranty for, and accepts no liability regarding your purchase of a SportsBubble Site Product. You are solely responsible for any and all transactions utilizing your Personal Financial Information, including, but not limited to, any and all charges. You acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, in the event Processor experiences a data breach that affects your information, SportsBubble will in no way be responsible or liable to you for any such breach. Having said that, we only allow Processors to handle your personal information if we are satisfied they take appropriate and legally required measures to protect your personal information. We also impose contractual obligations on Processors relating to ensure they can only use your personal information to provide services to us and to you and protect and handle your data as is required.</p>
<p>

SportsBubble is under no obligation to store any records related to purchases or other transactions you make through the SportsBubble Services. You should therefore maintain records of all your transactions. If you have any questions regarding your transactions or believe that there is an error or unauthorized transaction or activity associated with transactions utilizing your information, you must contact the Processor.</p>

If you use the SportsBubble Sites or the SportsBubble Services from a jurisdiction other than the United States, you agree that you do so of your own initiative, and you are responsible for complying with local laws as applicable to your use of the SportsBubble Sites or the SportsBubble Services.</p>
<p>
<strong>U.S. Export Controls</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver</strong></p>
<p>
(1) SportsBubble, including its SportsBubble Affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, and you agree that any Dispute (as defined herein) between you and SportsBubble, regarding any aspect of your relationship with SportsBubble, will be resolved in a binding, confidential, individual and fair arbitration process, and not in court.  <strong>Each of you and SportsBubble agrees to give up the right to sue in court. </strong></p>
<p>
(2) The term "Dispute" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any dispute, claim, demand, count, cause of action, or controversy between you and SportsBubble, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory.  The term "Dispute" specifically includes, but is not limited to, any disputes, actions, claims, or controversies between you and SportsBubble that arise from or in any way relate to or concern any Content, products or services provided by SportsBubble including but not limited to the SportsBubble Services (as defined above), this Arbitration Agreement, any other aspect of these Terms of Use (including their applicability and their conformance to Applicable Law), any billing disputes, and any disputes relating to telephonic, text message, or any other communications either of us received from the other.  The only exceptions to this Arbitration Agreement are that (i) each of you and SportsBubble retains the right to sue in small claims court and (ii) each of you and SportsBubble may bring suit in court against the other to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.  Disputes over whether these exceptions apply shall be resolved by the court in which such action has been brought; all other disputes over arbitrability shall be resolved by the arbitrator. </p>
<p>
<strong>(3) Each of you and SportsBubble also agrees to give up the ability to seek to represent, in a class action or otherwise, anyone but each of you and SportsBubble </strong>(see paragraph 9 below). </p>
<p>
 (4) There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.  An arbitrator must follow this Arbitration Agreement.  The arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages); provided that they are recoverable under these Terms of Use. </p>
<p>
(5) These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of the Terms of Use.</p>
<p>
(6) Any arbitration between you and SportsBubble will be conducted by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS"), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures effective July 1, 2014 (the "JAMS Rules"), as modified by this agreement to arbitrate.  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator, and if you and SportsBubble cannot agree on who that single arbitrator will be, the arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the JAMS Rules, with the participation and involvement of SportsBubble and you pursuant to JAMS Rule 12.  The JAMS Rules are available on its website at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration" title="JAMS Rules" target="_blank">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration</a> .  The Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards are available at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards" title="JAMS standards" target="_blank">https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards</a>. The arbitrator is bound by these Terms of Use.</p>
<p>
(7) If either you or SportsBubble wish to arbitrate a claim, you or SportsBubble must first send by mail to the other a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice") that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice, the specific facts giving rise to the Dispute, the SportsBubble Service to which the Notice relates, and the relief requested.  Your Notice to SportsBubble must be sent by mail to: SportsBubble, Arbitration Notice of Dispute, 3630 High Street # 18941, Oakland, California, 94619.   SportsBubble will send any Notice to you at the contact information we have for you or that you provide.  It is the sender’s responsibility to ensure that the recipient receives the Notice.  During the first 45 days after you or we send a Notice to the other, you and we may try to reach a settlement of the Dispute. </p>
<p>
(8) If you and we do not resolve the Dispute within 45 days, either you or we may initiate arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Rules.  Further instructions on submitting a Demand for Arbitration may be found at<a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/files/Uploads/Documents/JAMS_Arbitration_Demand.pdf" title="JAMS pdf" target="_blank"> http://www.jamsadr.com/files/Uploads/Documents/JAMS_Arbitration_Demand.pdf </a>.  In addition to filing this Demand for Arbitration with JAMS in accordance with its rules and procedures, you must send a copy of this completed Demand for Arbitration to SportsBubble at the address listed above to which you sent your Notice of Dispute. </p>
<p>
(9) You and SportsBubble acknowledge and agree to abide by the following rules for arbitration:
 (a) YOU AND SPORTSBUBBLE MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR MULTI-CLAIMANT PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO POWER TO AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (b) SportsBubble will pay arbitration costs as required by the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards and consistent with paragraph 6 below; (c) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by Applicable Law and these Terms of Use; and (d) each side pays its own attorneys' fees, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 10 below.</p>
<p>
(10) JAMS charges filing and other fees to conduct arbitrations.  Ordinarily, the claimant has to pay the filing fee to initiate arbitration, but if you wish to commence an arbitration against SportsBubble, you and SportsBubble acknowledge and agree to abide by the following:</p>
<p>
If you are seeking to recover less than $10,000 (inclusive of attorneys’ fees), SportsBubble will pay the filing fee on your behalf or reimburse your payment of it.</p>
<p>
If you are seeking to recover $10,000 or more, you will have to pay the filing fee charged by JAMS, but SportsBubble will reimburse the filing fee if you prevail on all claims decided upon by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>
SportsBubble and you agree that, if the claims to be arbitrated total less than $10,000 (inclusive of attorneys’ fees), the claim ordinarily should be decided on written submissions only, without a telephonic or in-person hearing. SportsBubble will not request a hearing for any claims totaling less than $10,000.  This provision shall not be construed by the arbitrator to deprive you of any rights you may have to a telephonic or in-person hearing in your hometown area pursuant to the JAMS Rules.</p>
<p>
SportsBubble and you agree that, if the claims to be arbitrated total $10,000 or more, the arbitration will occur in a manner and place consistent with the JAMS Rules.</p>
<p>
(11) Regardless of how the arbitration proceeds, each of you and SportsBubble shall cooperate in good faith in the exchange of non-privileged documents and information as necessary in accordance with the JAMS Rules, and the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain his or her findings and conclusions.</p>
<p>
(12) Each of you and SportsBubble may incur attorneys’ fees during the arbitration.  Each side agrees to pay its own attorneys' fees unless the claim(s) at issue permit the prevailing party to be paid its attorneys' fees, and in such instance, the fees awarded shall be determined by the Applicable Law(s). In addition to whatever rights you may have to recover your attorneys’ fees under Applicable Law, if you prevail in the arbitration, and if SportsBubble failed to make a settlement offer to you before the arbitration or the amount you win is at least 25% greater than SportsBubble’s highest settlement offer, then SportsBubble will pay your reasonable attorneys’ fees in addition to the amount the arbitrator awarded.  If SportsBubble wins the arbitration, you will be responsible for your own attorneys’ fees.  In addition, if the arbitrator, at the request of the winning party, finds that the losing party brought a claim or asserted a defense frivolously or for an improper purpose, then regardless of the amount in dispute, the arbitrator must order the losing party to pay both sides’ arbitration fees and may order the losing party to pay the winning party’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, unless such an award of fees is prohibited by Applicable Law.</p>
<p>
(13) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief, only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim, only as permitted by Applicable Law, and only to the extent that declaratory and injunctive relief are permitted by these Terms of Use.  The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive, exemplary, multiplied or consequential damages or any other relief not allowed under this Arbitration Agreement.  The arbitrator also may not order SportsBubble to pay any monies to or take any actions with respect to persons other than you, unless SportsBubble explicitly consents in advance, after an arbitrator is selected, to permit the arbitrator to enter such an order.  Further, unless SportsBubble expressly agrees, the arbitrator may not consolidate other persons’ claims with yours, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, multi-claimant or class proceeding. </p>
<p>
(14) You and SportsBubble agree to maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and shall not disclose the fact of the arbitration, any documents exchanged as part of any mediation,  proceedings of the arbitration, the arbitrator’s decision and the existence or amount of any award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration (in which case anyone becoming privy to confidential information must undertake to preserve its confidentiality), or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a provisional remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, an order confirming the award, or unless otherwise required by law or court order. In keeping with the confidential nature of the arbitration, You and SportsBubble agree that an order confirming award is only necessary if the obligations of the award have not been performed.  Therefore, before taking any steps to confirm the arbitration award, the party seeking confirmation of the award must give the other party notice of its intention to confirm the award.  If the party who would be the respondent in any such confirmation proceeding performs its obligation under the terms of the arbitration award within 15 business days of such notice, the party who gave notice of its intent to confirm the award shall not seek to confirm or otherwise enforce the award.</p>
<p>
(15) With the exception of subpart (a) in paragraph (9) (i.e., the waiver of the ability to proceed on behalf of multiple claimants or a purported class), if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the balance of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in effect and be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, or illegal provision were not contained. If, however, subpart (a) in paragraph (9) is found invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, but the rest of these Terms, including the provisions governing where actions against SportsBubble must be pursued, the choice of governing law, and our mutual waiver of the right to a trial by jury, will remain in effect and apply to any claim that, for this or any other reason, proceeds in court rather than in arbitration.</p>
<p>
Governing Law</p>
<p>
This Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
<p>
Except with respect to Disputes to be resolved through an arbitration process in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement contained above, you and SportsBubble agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in San Francisco, CA to resolve any Dispute arising out of the Agreement or the SportsBubble Services. </p>
<p>
YOU HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, OR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>
YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SITE OR SPORTSBUBBLE SERVICES MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. AFTER SUCH PERIOD, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
<p>
Indemnity</p>
<p>
You agree to indemnify and hold SportsBubble, its Affiliates, each advertiser, sponsor and their advertising agencies, subcontractors and other partners, and their respective officers, agents, partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with your use or misuse of the SportsBubble Sites or the SportsBubble Services (including, without, limitation, any use of your account, whether or not authorized by you), your breach of this Agreement, your violation of any rights of another or any Content that you Transmit through the SportsBubble Services.</p>
<p>
Unsolicited Submissions</p>
<p>
SportsBubble does not knowingly accept, via the SportsBubble Services or otherwise, unsolicited submissions including, without limitation, submissions by you of blog ideas, articles, scripts, story lines, fan fiction, characters, drawings, information, suggestions, proposals, ideas or concepts. SportsBubble requests that you do not make any unsolicited submissions. Any similarity between an unsolicited submission and any elements in any SportsBubble or Affiliated SportsBubble creative work including, without limitation, a story, title or concept would be purely coincidental. If you do send any submissions to SportsBubble via the SportsBubble Services that are unsolicited (including but not limited to any Forum), however, you agree that (i) your unsolicited submissions are not being made in confidence or trust and that by making such submissions no contractual or fiduciary relationship is created between you and SportsBubble; (ii) any such unsolicited submissions and copyright become the property of and will be owned by SportsBubble (and are not User Content licensed by you to SportsBubble) and may be used, copied, sublicensed, adapted, transmitted, distributed, publicly performed, published, displayed or deleted as SportsBubble sees fit; (iii) you are not entitled to any compensation, credit or notice whatsoever in connection with such submissions; and (iv) by sending an unsolicited submission you waive the right to make any claim against SportsBubble or SportsBubble Affiliates relating to any unsolicited submissions by you, including, without limitation, unfair competition, breach of implied contract or breach of confidentiality.</p>
<p>
Employment Opportunities</p>
<p>
SportsBubble may, from time to time, post SportsBubble employment opportunities on the SportsBubble Services and/or invite users to submit resumes to it. If you choose to submit your name, contact information, resume and/or other personal information to SportsBubble in response to employment listings, you are authorizing SportsBubble to utilize this information for all lawful and legitimate hiring and employment purposes. SportsBubble also reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to forward the information you submit to its SportsBubble Affiliates for legitimate business purposes. Nothing in this Agreement or contained in the SportsBubble Services will constitute a promise by SportsBubble to contact, interview, hire or employ any individual who submits information to it, nor will anything in this Agreement or contained in the SportsBubble Services constitute a promise that SportsBubble will review any or all of the information submitted to it by users of the SportsBubble Services.</p>
<p>
Other</p>
<p>
The failure of SportsBubble to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The Section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. This Agreement operates to the fullest extent permissible by law. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, if any provision of this Agreement is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision is deemed severable from this Agreement and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
<p>
You agree that any notices SportsBubble may be required by Applicable Law to send to you will be effective upon SportsBubble’s sending an e-mail message to the e-mail address you have on file with SportsBubble or publishing such notices on the informational page(s) of the SportsBubble Services.</p>
<p>
You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and SportsBubble as a result of this Agreement or your use of SportsBubble Services.

<p>
Nothing contained in this Agreement limits SportsBubble’s right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of SportsBubble Services or information provided to or gathered by us in connection with such use.</p>

<strong>USE OF COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</strong></p>
<p>

We also use cookies and similar technologies for purposes of marketing and advertising. In those jurisdictions that require it, we allow the data subject to give explicit permission or to deny the use of certain categories of cookies. A “cookie” is a small text file that a web server stores in browser software. A browser sends cookies to a server when the browser makes a connection to the server (for example, when requesting a web page from the same domain that created the cookie). The purpose of cookies is to remember the browser over time and distinguish one browser instance (or user) from all others. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to track Personal Data previously entered by a user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them, and how to remove them. Cookies can remember login information, preferences, and similar information. Cookies, as well as other tracking technologies, such as HTML5 local storage, and Local Shared Objects (such as “Flash” cookies), and similar mechanisms, may record information such as a unique identifier, information you enter in a form, IP address, and other categories of data. We may also use web beacons or “pixels,” and in certain circumstances may collect IP address, screen resolution and browser software and operating system types, clickstream patterns, dates and times that our Site is accessed, and other categories of data. If you want to block the use and saving of cookies, you should take the necessary steps within your browser’s settings to block all cookies from SportsBubble and its external serving vendors, or use the cookie control system, if available upon first visit. Please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, certain parts of the Services may not function correctly. For instance, we may not be able to store your preferences or login information or customize Content and advertising to your viewing habits. For information on how to disable cookies, refer to your browser’s documentation.</p>
<p>

<p>


<strong>INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING</strong></p>
<p>
We may disclose various types of information for purposes of interest-based advertising, including for third-party interest-based advertising. Interest-based advertising is advertising that is targeted to you based on your web browsing and app usage over time and across websites or applications. Our advertising practices may also include the use of Personal Data to create de-identified audience segments that can be used for targeted marketing and interest-based advertising on the Site as well as third party services and platforms, mobile apps, and/or websites. Prior to use, the segments are de-identified so that they will not identify You personally. You have the option to restrict the use of information for interest-based advertising and to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads. Depending on from where you access the Services, you may also be asked to consent to our use of cookies, including advertising cookies. The opt-outs for interest-based advertising require that strictly necessary cookies are not blocked by the settings in your web browser. You can opt-out of interest-based advertising with participating entities for each region at <strong><a href="https://optout.aboutads.info" title="Ad Choices" target="_blank">Ad Choices</a></strong>. This website also provides detailed information about how interest-based advertising works. Opting out does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising from us, or when you use the Internet. It just means that the data collected from our website will not be used for interest-based advertising and that the advertising you see displayed on websites will not be customized to your interests.</p>
<p>

To opt-out of direct marketing communications, please see the instructions in the “Withdrawing Your Consent” section of this Privacy <strong>Notice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>


Data Portability</strong></p>
<p>

<strong>Lodge a Complaint</strong></p>
<p>
You have the right to lodge a complaint. To exercise your rights, you may contact us as at <a href="mailto:privacy@sportsbubble.io" title="contact us" target="_blank">privacy@sportsbubble.io.</a> As permitted by law, certain data elements may not be subject to access, modification, portability, restriction and/or deletion. Where permissible, we may charge for this service. We will respond to reasonable requests as soon as practicable and as required by law. To protect your privacy and security, we may take steps to verify your identity in order to respond to your request. To manage your data, you can contact us via e-mail with any requests that you may have.</p>
<p>

Data subjects in certain jurisdictions including Nevada and California may have certain rights under applicable data protection laws, including the right to request confirmation from us as to whether or not we are processing your Personal Data.</p>
<p>

To manage your data, you can contact us via e-mail with any requests that you may have. You can request access to all your personally identifiable information and manage your data, including your withdrawal of consent, by sending an e-mail to us at:  <a href="mailto:privacy@sportsbubble.io" title="contact us" target="_blank">privacy@sportsbubble.io</a>. Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where such requests are unreasonably repetitive, would require a disproportionate effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems). We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate a law or cause the information to be incorrect. Please note that you may only make a California resident CCPA-related data access or data portability disclosure request twice within a 12-month period. If you choose to contact directly by phone, post or email, you will need to provide us with: enough information to identify you; proof of your identity and address; and, a description of what right you want to exercise and the information to which your request relates. Please know that we are not obligated to make a data access or data portability disclosure if we cannot verify that the person making the request is the person about whom we collected information, or is someone authorized to act on such person’s behalf. Also, you should know that any personal information we collect from you to verify your identity in connection with you request will be used solely for the purposes of verification.</p>
<p>

<strong>WITHDRAWING YOUR CONSENT </strong></p>
<p>
In most cases, we need to process certain of your Personal Data in order to fulfill our contractual obligations to you and for our legitimate interests. Where the basis of processing is legitimate interests, you have a right to object to the processing of your Personal Data. Please note that, subject to applicable law, we may continue to process your Personal Data even where you object if there are compelling legitimate grounds for processing that override your interests and rights, or where processing is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims. Where consent is the basis of processing, you may at any time withdraw the consent you provided for the processing of your Personal Data for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Notice by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sportsbubble.io" title="contact us" target="_blank">privacy@sportsbubble.io</a> provided that we are not required by applicable law or professional standards to retain such information. If you would like to stop receiving marketing or promotional messages, notifications, or updates from us, you may do so by following the unsubscribe instructions that appear in e-mail communications. Please be advised that you may not be able to opt-out of receiving certain service or transactional messages from us, including legal notices and certain communications related to the provision of the Services. Please note that if you withdraw your consent or object to processing, or if you choose not to provide certain Personal Data, we may be unable to provide you some or all of the Services.</p>
<p>


<strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>
We implement technical and organizational security measures designed to secure and protect Personal Data. Please note, however, we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with the storage and transmission of Personal Data.</p>
<p>


<strong>INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE </strong></p>
<p>
We do not knowingly collect or store information from individuals under the age of 18 years without parental consent. If you become aware that an individual under 13 years of age has provided us with Personal Data without parental consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sportsbubble.io" title="contact us" target="_blank">privacy@sportsbubble.io</a>.

<p>


<strong>DO-NOT-TRACK</strong></p>
<p>
Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative that has developed a “flag” or signal that an Internet user may activate in the user’s browser software to notify websites that the user does not wish to be “tracked” by third-parties as defined by the initiative. Do-Not-Track is not yet standardized and therefore SportsBubble does not alter its behavior or use practices when we receive a Do Not Track signal from your browser.</p>
